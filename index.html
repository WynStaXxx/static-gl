It is the term used to describe any marketing efforts that place on the internet or a digital device. It has different channels that enable the business to entice their customer into buying their product & services. Philip Kotler is considered the father of digital marketing who is the author of 60 marketing books and provides us important lessons that can be applied to our digital strategy. Before digital marketing, we have Traditional marketing, which is a conventional mode of marketing that helps to reach out to the semi-targeted audience with various offline advertising & promotion modes. CONSTITUENT OF DIGITAL MARKETING TRAFFIC ACQUISITION CHANNELS SEARCH ENGINE MARKETING(SEM): It is a form of internet marketing that involves the promotion of websites by increasing their visibility in search engine result pages (SERP) primarily through paid advertising. SEM may incorporate search engine optimization (SEO), which adjusts or rewrites website content and site architecture to achieve a higher ranking in search engine result pages to enhance pay per click. SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING: Social media marketing involves the use of social media platforms to connect with the audience to build your brand, increase sales & drive website traffic. It also allows to publish great content on social media platforms & run social media advertisements. Major social media platforms are Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, YouTube, and Snapchat. EMAIL MARKETING: It is an act of sending a commercial message particularly to a group of people, using email. It involves using emails to send advertisements, request business, or sales, or donations. It usually refers to sending email to enhance a merchant's relationship with a current or previous customer, encouraging customer loyalty, acquiring new customers, or convincing new customers to purchase something immediately. DISPLAY ADVERTISING: It is an online form of advertising in which a company's Ads appear on third-party sites or appear on the search engine result page such as publishers or social networks. This advertisement can increase the website page view of a company from most types of customers except the non-unauthenticated visitor who visits the site before. The main purpose of display advertising is to support brand awareness and it also helps to increase the purchase, intention of the consumers. AFFILIATE MARKETING: It is a type of performance-based marketing in which a business reward one or more affiliates for each visitor or customer brought by the affiliate's marketing efforts. The internet has increased the prominence of affiliate marketing. Amazon popularized the practice by creating the affiliate marketing program whereby the website and bloggers put the link to the Amazon page for a reviewed product to receive an advertising fee when a purchase is made. So, it is essentially a pay-for-performance marketing program where the act of selling is outsourced across a vast network. SUPPORTING CHANNELS MOBILE MARKETING: Mobile marketing is a multi-channel, digital marketing strategy aimed at reaching a target audience on their smartphones, tablets, or other mobile devices via websites, email, social media, and Apps. Mobile marketing is an important piece of the puzzle when it comes to building out any short-term or long-term marketing plan. From email to pay per click (PPC), search engine optimization (SEO)content marketing, and social media marketing, there is a mobile marketing channel to reach every part of your audience where they are most comfortable. mobile marketing can do wonders to drive brand value.

It is the term used to describe any marketing efforts that place on the internet or a digital device. It has different channels that enable the business to entice their customer into buying their product & services. Philip Kotler is considered the father of digital marketing who is the author of 60 marketing books and provides us important lessons that can be applied to our digital strategy. Before digital marketing, we have Traditional marketing, which is a conventional mode of marketing that helps to reach out to the semi-targeted audience with various offline advertising & promotion modes. CONSTITUENT OF DIGITAL MARKETING TRAFFIC ACQUISITION CHANNELS SEARCH ENGINE MARKETING(SEM): It is a form of internet marketing that involves the promotion of websites by increasing their visibility in search engine result pages (SERP) primarily through paid advertising. SEM may incorporate search engine optimization (SEO), which adjusts or rewrites website content and site architecture to achieve a higher ranking in search engine result pages to enhance pay per click. SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING: Social media marketing involves the use of social media platforms to connect with the audience to build your brand, increase sales & drive website traffic. It also allows to publish great content on social media platforms & run social media advertisements. Major social media platforms are Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, YouTube, and Snapchat. EMAIL MARKETING: It is an act of sending a commercial message particularly to a group of people, using email. It involves using emails to send advertisements, request business, or sales, or donations. It usually refers to sending email to enhance a merchant's relationship with a current or previous customer, encouraging customer loyalty, acquiring new customers, or convincing new customers to purchase something immediately. DISPLAY ADVERTISING: It is an online form of advertising in which a company's Ads appear on third-party sites or appear on the search engine result page such as publishers or social networks. This advertisement can increase the website page view of a company from most types of customers except the non-unauthenticated visitor who visits the site before. The main purpose of display advertising is to support brand awareness and it also helps to increase the purchase, intention of the consumers. AFFILIATE MARKETING: It is a type of performance-based marketing in which a business reward one or more affiliates for each visitor or customer brought by the affiliate's marketing efforts. The internet has increased the prominence of affiliate marketing. Amazon popularized the practice by creating the affiliate marketing program whereby the website and bloggers put the link to the Amazon page for a reviewed product to receive an advertising fee when a purchase is made. So, it is essentially a pay-for-performance marketing program where the act of selling is outsourced across a vast network. SUPPORTING CHANNELS MOBILE MARKETING: Mobile marketing is a multi-channel, digital marketing strategy aimed at reaching a target audience on their smartphones, tablets, or other mobile devices via websites, email, social media, and Apps. Mobile marketing is an important piece of the puzzle when it comes to building out any short-term or long-term marketing plan. From email to pay per click (PPC), search engine optimization (SEO)content marketing, and social media marketing, there is a mobile marketing channel to reach every part of your audience where they are most comfortable. mobile marketing can do wonders to drive brand value.
